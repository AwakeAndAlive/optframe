FCore Library
=============

FCore stands for OptFrame Functional Core, which is a simplified version of OptFrame Classic.
FCore was introduced in OptFrame v4.1, with functional-style abstractions for mostly used OptFrame components.
It is fully compatible with OptFrame classic, so users are able to interchange components (including all available metaheuristics).

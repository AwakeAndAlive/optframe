## Optimization Functional Core Library

This project puts OptFCore project into a shared library.

This is quite experimental, trying to adapt coroutines and other newest features into optframe lib.
Python project already has its own implementation of OptFrame library, without any C++20 feature (limited to C++17).

### Who uses this project?

Anyone that wants to use general optframe support directly without embedded compiling all .hpp files.

Python implementation of OptFrame will use this library to provide direct support of OptFrame internals.

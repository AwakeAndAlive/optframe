Heuristics modules
==================

The Heuristics package from OptFrame provides several implementations of classic heuristics and metaheuristics.

To build a metaheuristic, one needs to pass problem-specific components, either directly in C++ constructor or by using a component builder string syntax.
For every proposed metaheuristic, there are one or more component builders, so feel free to explore them.
On extended implementations of OptFrame, such as OptFrame Python (a.k.a, pyoptframe), component builders are mandatory.

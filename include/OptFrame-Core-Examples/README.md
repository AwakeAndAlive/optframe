## OptFrame-Core-Examples

These are **Core Examples** strutured to help development of OptFrame.

Differently from external *Examples/* folder, which are actual showcases, 
these propose **header files only** as `.hpp` libraries that may be used for testing.

Note that main `.cpp` files that use these core examples are hosted inside external *Examples/*
folder or in *tests/* folder, as this also prevents the need to store .cpp files here, and also dettaches the purpose of solely testing structures, instead of just acting as showcases.
Most external *Examples/* are self-contained, but many depend on structures here as well.

Finally, the external *demo/* folder only acts as learning-based tutorials, being demos for specific
components and structures for learning, not complete showcases, as *Examples/*.

## OptFrame Demo 01 - Quickstart Welcome

![C++17](https://img.shields.io/badge/std-c%2B%2B17-blue)

This demo is intended to work with bazel remote OptFrame repository, instead of local.

Note that [WORKSPACE.bazel](./WORKSPACE.bazel) includes `git_repository` pointing to `master` branch of
`https://github.com/optframe/optframe.git`.

Other demos do not have this behavior, as they are intended to run on local copies of OptFrame,
related as `../../`

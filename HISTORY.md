## A brief history of OptFrame

### OptFrame v1
* Born on 2007 at Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Ouro Preto/MG, Brazil
* Very early phases of project, mostly used for Open Pit Mining optimization and VNS/ILS
* Too many type casts (no templates yet!)
* No efficient version control for source files

### OptFrame v2
* Adopted templates and nice metaprogramming design
* Adopted SVN version control
* Evolution on many aspects, due to collaborations on Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niterói/RJ, Brazil
* Mostly maintained by four initial OptHouse members: Igor Machado, Sabir Ribas, Pablo Munhoz and Mário Perché

### OptFrame v3
* Stable release with many techniques for Single and Multi-objective
* Automated runtime testing with CheckCommand
* Practical implementations on several Master and PhD thesis
* Professional implementations on industry software
* Moved to Git source control
* Mostly maintained by Igor Machado and Vitor Nazário Coelho

### OptFrame v4
* Just born with C++ Concepts in mind!
* Byproduct of several worldwide collaborations, with best known software management practices
* Focusing on achieving maximum C++ performance, solving too many memory management complex strategies (fully using self managed memory by smart pointers and move semantics)
* Maximum personalization by the user

### OptFrame v5
* Stability and focus on long-term maintainance
* Support for cross-language implementations, such as pyoptframe in Python
* Improve examples, demos and documentation

## Special thanks for SourceForge.net (written at 2016)

The OptFrame project was hosted in SourceForge.net for 8 years and we are
very grateful for all support during this time. Thanks to this support, we
have published several academic papers and solved many large scale problems
during these years. In order to easily interact with new project collaborators
the project is now moved to GitHub platform.

Thanks a lot SourceForge/GitHub!
